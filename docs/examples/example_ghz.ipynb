    "# Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) State Fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this benchmark is to show whether a GHZ state with high enough fidelity can be prepared such that the state is genuinely multipartite entangled. One can show that a fidelity larger than 0.5 is a sufficient condition (see Leibfried, D. et al., Creation of a six-atom ‘Schrödinger cat’ state. Nature 438, 639–642 (2005))\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark currently offers two methods to estimate the fidelity:\n",
    "* Multiple quantum coherences (G. J. Mooney et al., Generation and verification of 27-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states in a superconducting quantum computer, J. Phys. Commun. 5, 095004 (2021))\n",
    "* Randomized measurements (Elben, A. et al., Statistical correlations between locally randomized measurements: A toolbox for probing entanglement in many-body quantum states, Phys. Rev. A 99, 052323 (2019))\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for a given set of $n$ qubits, different circuits can be applied which lead to the same GHZ state. Currently there are the following implementations:\n",
    "* \"naive\": The textbook ciruit of depth $n$, which starts from a Hadamrd gate on one qubit and entangles each additional qubit with a CNOT operation from the first.\n",
    "* \"log_depth\": A logarithmic depth circuit utilizing parallel CNOT applications. Either the method in Cruz et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05572 or the method in Mooney et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08946 is used, depending on which yields the lower depth or the lower number of 2-qubit gates. \n",
    "* \"tree\": An in-house logarithmic depth circuit utilizing calibration data of the CZ-fidelities and a tree-graph algorithm to find a circuit with minimal depth and high fidelity 2-qubit gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first two methods will always give the same circuit for the same qubit layout (and the same coupling map), while the \"tree\" method relies on the latest calibration fidelities and can give different circuits on different days. \n",
    "Thus for consistent comparisons one of the first two methods should be chosen, while for the best results, i.e. the largest possible GME entangled GHZ state, the tree-method is preferable."

This strategy should improve outcomes in most cases."

Which of these is used can be controlled by the ``sq_metric`` argument, which can be set to \"fidelity\" \"readout\", or \"coherence\", where the latter option leads to the idle fidelities being shown.\n",

Furthermore the \"Edge map\" is printed, which is the list of qubit pairs on which CZ gates act in the GHZ circuit. The list is ordered, so the first pair is scheduled first, and so on. CZ-Gates on subsequent pairs that don't share the same qubit are executed in parallel. "
